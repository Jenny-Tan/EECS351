## Motivation
The digitalized music has brought joy and entertainment to the society for decades. It makes the composition richer, carries the old recordings back to life, and even produces amazing effects. Musical audio processing will include various forms of digital signal processing methods. As a group sharing interest in music production, we decide to implement various common sound effects using MATLAB.

## QuickStart
1. Download all the files into the repository
2. Run the `auidoEffectBoxUI.mlapp` by double-click and select `run` inside the app designer
3. Enjoy and have fun!

## Files for different functionalities
# 1. The equalization: 
`shelving.m`, `shelvingDemo.m`, `delay.m`, 
# 2. The reverberation:
`allpassFilter.m`, `combFilter.m`, `pre_delay.m`, `reverb.m`
# 3. The distortion:
`P_combine.m`, `findpitchmarks.m`, `PSOLA.m`
